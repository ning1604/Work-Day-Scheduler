# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

The following calendar application allows a user to save events for each hour of the day so that when the page is refreshed the saved events persist. When the user views the timeblocks for the day, each timeblock will be color coded to indicate whether it is in the past (grey), present (red), or future (green).


  1. The URL of the deployed application: https://ning1604.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/
